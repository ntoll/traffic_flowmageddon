Traffic Flowmageddon
====================

A very simple game written for `PyWeek 26 <https://pyweek.org/26/>`_ by
`Andrew Smith <https://twitter.com/wiresmith/>`_ and
`Nicholas H.Tollervey <https://twitter.com/ntoll>`_ (instructions for
installing and running the game are at the end of this document).

`Read the developer diaries for the game online <https://pyweek.org/e/code-to-joy/>`_.

All the code was created using the `Mu code editor <https://codewith.mu/>`_ and
`PyGameZero by Dan Pope <https://pygame-zero.readthedocs.io/en/stable/>`_.

The source code is released under the MIT license (see the LICENSE file in this
repository for more information).

Installing / Running the Game
=============================

**Traffic Flowmageddon only works with Python 3!**

I've tested the game works on Windows 10 (64bit), OSX (High Sierra) and Ubuntu
Linux (18.04).

Installation of the dependencies is relatively simple::

    $ pip3 install pgzero

Installing PyGame Zero will grab PyGame and other associated requirements.

Simply change directories into the root of the project (i.e.  the directory in
which you'll find this file) and type::

    $ pgzrun flow.py

... then avoid those Zombies..!

Most of all, we hope you have as much fun playing it as we did writing it!
